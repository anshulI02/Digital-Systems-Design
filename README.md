# Simple iPod
Overview
This project is part of the CPEN311 course at the University of British Columbia. The objective of this lab is to design and implement a simple iPod using Finite State Machines (FSMs), Flash Memory, and a keyboard interface. The project mimics the functionality of an iPod, where sound samples stored in Flash memory are read and played through an audio device, and user interactions are managed through a keyboard interface.
